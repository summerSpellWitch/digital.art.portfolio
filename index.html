    <p>The above images were made by opening them in a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++. The effect was created by deleting or moving portions of the text around which results in a partially corrupt or glitchy looking image. This method has the side effect of possibly fully corrupting the image, forcing one to restart from the beginning. Click on any image to view a larger version.</p>

      </a>
    </div>
    <p>Here is a vector drawing created entirely within Adobe Illustrator using only the pen tool. A reference image was taken with a DSLR then imported into Illustrator where the "Image Trace" function was used. Using the pen tool to basically copy the image trace, correctly layering the shapes created with the pen tool, and color picking from the reference image the result is the image above.</p>

    <p>This is a sculpture made out of 12-gauge wire using a sword from the game Minecraft as the reference. It was made using pliers and wirecutters to bend and cut the wire into the appropriate shape. Two silhouettes of the sword's overall shape were first made then sandwiched on top of each other. More wire was then used to hold them in place and form the criss-crossing sections. Click on any image to view a larger version.</p>

    <p>Pictured above is a wooden "puzzle" cut from a piece of pine wood with a mineral oil finish. The idea behind it was to create something with a sense of direction / flow, like a containted ball of wind. Its creation started with sketches which were then iterated into the final design as seen above. The final design was then photographed, uploaded and traced over in Adobe Illustrator for clarity, then printed out to be used as a template for the wood cutting. The pieces were then sanded smooth and given a rounded edge.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The above video was made for a class. Using recorded footage from the games Yume Nikki, Minecraft, Terraria and Teardown, the idea behind the video was to combine the games together in a dream sequence that slowly starts to degrade over time. The video starts with the character going to bed. Every time she enters and exits a door the dream she's in slowly gets more and more decayed until she pinches herself to wake up.</p>

    </div>
    <p>For this video I wanted to use the sounds of church bells and a ticking grandfather clock in some way. The gameplay footage is from Minecraft and an indie game called Lunacid. The interlaced footage of Lunacid follows the player as they descend into a seemingly empty crypt before ultimately meeting their demise.</p>
